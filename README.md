# 📝 React Todo List — "Because I’ll totally remember it later... right?"

Welcome to my **React-powered Todo List**, built entirely with `useReducer`, questionable motivation, and too much caffeine ☕.

It’s clean. It’s fast. It’s *way* too advanced for a todo app. 😌

## ⚡ Features

- ➕ **Add Todos** – Type, press enter, boom, task created  
- ✅ **Toggle Todos** – Cross off that thing you definitely did (probably)  
- ✏️ **Edit Todos** – Because plans change, and spelling mistakes happen  
- ❌ **Delete Todos** – Make them disappear like your workout goals  
- 🔍 **Filter by Name** – Find tasks faster than your attention span  
- 🙈 **Hide Completed** – Out of sight, out of guilt  
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** – Press `Enter` to add like a pro  
- 💪 Built entirely with **useReducer** — one hook to manage them all

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to juggle multiple states in one reducer (and survive)  
- Why derived state should *not* be stored (trust the render, bro)  
- The magic of `dispatch()` — feels like casting React spells  
- That editing a todo should feel smoother than your excuses

## 🚀 How to Run It

Clone it, install dependencies, and start your path to “organization” (allegedly):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-todolist.git
cd react-todolist
npm install
npm run dev
